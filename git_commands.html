		The first step is to download a project repository from github by using command:
	</p>
	<p class="command">
		1-&quot;git clone &lt;URL&gt;&quot;
	</p>
	<p class="comment">
		Please don't make extra directory because git clone download all file in separate file.so don't worry.
		After download you can change and save it after that commit them. but now if you see git status, it
		says your branch is ahead of orgin/master by 1 commit (orgin is name of remote). So next step is to Upload
		you change to github.
	</p>
	<p class="command">
		2-git push orgin master
	</p>
	<p class="comment">
		After this step github authenticate you to know that who you are and have permition to change and commit.
		If all things are right you can see you changes on github. and number of commit increased by your push.
	</p>
	<p class="comment">
		Now the problem is if some one change orginal repository on github, how do you update your local master to
		last update. The answer is:
	</p>
	<p class="command">
		3-git pull orgin master
	</p>
	<p class="comment">
		Now forget all above commands ,assume you are in local host and your systwm admin want you to work on a
		repository remotly. first step is to define your remote for git as an orgin by using:
	</p>
	<p class="command">
		1.1-git remote add orgin &lt;URL of your repo&gt;
	</p>
	<p class="comment">
		Now following command say you what is your remote
	</p>
	<p class="command">
		1.2-git remote
	</p>
	<p class="comment">
		After complete your work. following command upload your work, if every things is true.
	</p>
	<p class="command">
		2.1-git push -u orgin master
	</p>
	<p class="comment">
		At the end ,the worth thing that can happen for a project that have multiple Participant on it, is
		Conflict betwaen two commit. this happen when you  corect a line in project and your partner
		correct same line with other way. your frind upload it changes. when you want to upload your repo,
		git crashes. because your change has conflict with now existing repo. In this position first step
		for you is <font color="#000000"> <b>git pull</b> </font> to recieve changes.git now reporting all wrong and you can see where
		conflict happen. <font color="#000000"> <b>git status</b> </font> can suggest you good solution.at last you should open conflicted file and
		edit them.for never seeing this conflict we suggest you when working on multi user project
		never Postponing your commit and immediately push it to your repo to this conflict not happen.
